# ‚öôÔ∏è **K3s-OpenFaaS setup**

This repository contains configuration files, manifests, and scripts for deploying [OpenFaaS](https://github.com/openfaas/faas) on a lightweight [K3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s) Kubernetes cluster

## üì¶ **What‚Äôs Inside**
- Installation scripts for K3s and OpenFaaS
- Basic usage examples and test functions

## üñß **Cluster Topology**
The K3s cluster in this setup consists of 3 nodes, communicating over a private network (`10.73.4.0/24`):

| Role       | Hostname   | IP Address    |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| Master     | master     | `10.73.4.40`  |
| Worker 1   | worker1    | `10.73.4.41`  |
| Worker 2   | worker2    | `10.73.4.42`  |

## üöÄ Quick Start
1. Clone this repo on all of your nodes:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justkow/k3s-openfaas-setup.git
   ```
1. Initialize system settings
   - On `master` node:
      ```bash
      ./initial_setup.sh master1
      ```
   - On `worker` nodes respectively:
      ```bash
      ./initial_setup.sh worker1
      ```
      ```bash
      ./initial_setup.sh worker2
      ```
2. Create `token` file with k3s token of your selection on all of your nodes (the token should be the same on master and workers):
   ```bash
   echo "your_token" > token
   ```
3. Install `k3s` on every node. The argument to the script is master node IP address:
   ```bash
   ./install_k3s.sh 10.73.4.40
   ```
   After installation, run this command to make sure that the process of setting up the cluster was successful:
   ```bash
   sudo kubectl get nodes
   ```
   The output should be similar to this:
   ```bash
   NAME      STATUS   ROLES                  AGE     VERSION
   master1   Ready    control-plane,master   10m     v1.32.4+k3s1
   worker1   Ready    <none>                 2m15s   v1.32.4+k3s1
   worker2   Ready    <none>                 4s      v1.32.4+k3s1
   ```
4. Install `docker` on master node:
   ```bash
   ./install_docker.sh
   ```
5. Install `OpenFaaS` on master node (provide master IP address as the argument for the script)
   > Note: If you run the script multiple times, you have to clean your .bashrc file manually
   ```bash
   sudo ./install_openfaas.sh 10.73.4.40
   ```
   To verify if installation was successful run:
   ```bash
   sudo kubectl get pods -n openfaas -o wide
   ```
   The output should look like this:
   ![OpenFaaS pods](images/pods.png)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running Python functions
All operation in this section are performed on master node. First you have to forward local port to OpenFaaS gateway service:
```bash
faas-port-forward
```
Then login to OpenFaaS:
```bash
faas-login
```
To run your serverless functions, you need to pull proper template from OpenFaaS repository. For our usecases, the `python-http` template will be used:
```bash
faas-cli template store pull python3-http
```

### Simple "Hello world!" function
Create the function by running command:
```bash
faas-cli new hello-world --lang python3-http
```

The function code is in the `hello-world/handler.py` file. You can modify it to return e.g.: "Hello world!"
```python
def handle(event, context):
    return "Hello world!\n"
```

Then you have to modify `stack.yaml` by adding address to your local Docker registry. The final `stack.yaml` should look like this:
```yaml
version: 1.0
provider:
  name: openfaas
  gateway: http://127.0.0.1:8080
functions:
  hello-openfaas:
    lang: python3-http
    handler: ./hello-world
    image: 10.73.4.40:5000/hello-world:latest
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```

Finally you have to:
1. Build image with the function
   ```bash
   sudo faas-cli build -f stack.yaml
   ```
2. Push it to the local Docker registry
   ```bash
   sudo faas-cli push -f stack.yaml
   ```
3. Deploy the function
   ```bash
   faas-cli deploy -f stack.yaml
   ```

You can verify if the pod with the function was created correctly by running command:
```bash
sudo kubectl get pods -n openfaas-fn -o wide
```
The output should look similar to this:
![Hello world](images/hello_world.png)

Now test you function by running:
```bash
echo "" | faas-cli invoke hello-world
```
